<h1>GeFi Technologies Pte Ltd Cookie Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date: November 8, 2025</strong></p>

<p>
    GeFi Technologies Pte Ltd ("GeFi," "we," "us," or "our"), a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore 
    with its principal place of business at Rue Robert-Caillat 6, 1204 Geneva, Switzerland, uses cookies and 
    similar technologies on our website (gefi.io or any affiliated sites) and Platform (including mobile applications, 
    AI Model Marketplace, federated learning tools, portfolio analytics, and risk management features). This Cookie 
    Policy explains what cookies are, how we use them, the types of cookies we employ, and how you can manage your 
    cookie preferences.
</p>

<p>
    This Policy is part of our Privacy Policy, which provides more details on data protection practices. By using the 
    Platform, you consent to our use of cookies as described herein, subject to your browser settings and applicable 
    laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, PDPA). If you do not agree, you can adjust your settings or refrain from using the Platform.
</p>

<h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
<p>
    Cookies are small text files placed on your device (e.g., computer, smartphone) when you visit a website. They store 
    information about your browsing activity and preferences, enabling features like remembering login details or tracking 
    usage. Similar technologies include web beacons, pixel tags, local storage, and scripts, which function like cookies.
</p>
<p>
    Cookies can be "session" (temporary, deleted when you close your browser) or "persistent" (remain until expired or deleted). 
    They can also be "first-party" (set by us) or "third-party" (set by partners for analytics or advertising).
</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
<p>We use cookies to enhance functionality, security, and user experience on the Platform. Given our focus on privacy-preserving AI and federated learning, we minimize data collection and ensure compliance with data protection laws. Cookies help us:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Provide Essential Services</strong>: Enable core features like account authentication, local model agent interactions, and secure aggregation.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve Performance</strong>: Analyze usage to optimize the Platform (e.g., loading times for portfolio tools).</li>
    <li><strong>Personalize Experience</strong>: Remember preferences (e.g., language, rebalancing settings) without sharing raw data.</li>
    <li><strong>Ensure Security</strong>: Detect anomalies (e.g., potential gradient poisoning) and enforce encryption.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and Research</strong>: Understand trends (e.g., model subscriptions) to refine AI models anonymously.</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing</strong>: With consent, deliver relevant promotions (e.g., Marketplace deals).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use cookies to track you across unrelated sites or sell data. All processing aligns with our zero data retention and end-to-end encryption principles.</p>
