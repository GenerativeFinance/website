<h3 class="display-2">Introduction & Scope</h3>
<div class="space20"></div>
<p>This Privacy Policy (“<strong>Policy</strong>”) explains how GeFi Technologies (“<strong>GeFi</strong>”, “<strong>Company</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you access our website, platform, or related services (“<strong>Services</strong>”).
