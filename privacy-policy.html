                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>GeFi Technologies Pte Ltd ("GeFi," "we," "us," or "our"), a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore with its principal place of business at Rue Robert-Caillat 6, 1204 Geneva, Switzerland, is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how we collect, use, share, and protect personal information when you access or use our platform, including our website (gefi.com or any affiliated sites), mobile applications, AI Model Marketplace, federated learning tools, portfolio analytics, risk management features, and related services (collectively, the "Platform").</p>

                    <p>By using the Platform, you consent to the practices described in this Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform. This Policy applies to users ("you" or "Users") including developers, financial institutions (e.g., banks, funds, insurers), data providers, and investors. For institutional users, a separate Data Processing Agreement may apply.</p>

                    <p>We comply with applicable data protection laws, including Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012 ("PDPA"), the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), and guidelines from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority ("FINMA") and Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS"). Our practices align with our federated AI architecture, ensuring no raw data leaves your local environment.</p>

                    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>We collect information to provide, improve, and secure the Platform. Categories include:</p>

                    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Account Data</strong>: Name, email address, institution details, phone number, and payment information (e.g., billing address) provided during registration or subscriptions.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Content</strong>: Inputs to Local Model Agents (LMAs), such as model designs, synthetic data, or feedback. Note: Raw proprietary financial data (e.g., local datasets for training) remains on your local environment and is never transmitted to us.</li>
                        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Interactions with the Platform, such as model selections (e.g., Quantum Risk Predictor), rebalancing actions, portfolio views, and API calls.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>1.2 Non-Personal Information</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Technical Data</strong>: IP address, device type, browser, operating system, and usage analytics (e.g., session duration, pages visited).</li>
                        <li><strong>Aggregated Insights</strong>: Anonymized model updates (e.g., encrypted gradients via homomorphic encryption or secure multiparty computation (MPC)) from federated learning, which do not identify individuals or institutions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking</strong>: We use essential cookies for functionality and analytics cookies (with consent) for performance tracking. See our Cookie Policy for details.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>1.3 Special Categories</h3>
                    <p>We do not collect sensitive data (e.g., health, racial origins) unless voluntarily provided for model training, in which case it is processed locally and pseudonymized.</p>

                    <h2>2. How We Collect Information</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Directly from You</strong>: During account creation, Marketplace subscriptions, or contributions to federated learning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Automatically</strong>: Via cookies, logs, and Platform interactions. For federated updates, only encrypted model parameters are received by the Federated Learning Orchestrator (FLO)—no raw data.</li>
                        <li><strong>From Third Parties</strong>: Market data feeds (e.g., stock prices) or payment processors (e.g., Stripe), subject to their policies. Data providers contribute structured/synthetic data, aggregated anonymously.</li>
                    </ul>
